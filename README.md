## Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer ðŸŽ¬

This project is a simple tool to help decide whether a movie is worth watching based on text reviews.

It combines two approaches for sentiment analysis:

> Scikit-learn (Multinomial Naive Bayes) â€“ Trains a basic model on sample movie reviews using CountVectorizer and MultinomialNB to predict positive/negative sentiments.

> TextBlob â€“ Provides polarity and subjectivity analysis to measure overall sentiment and tone of the reviews.

Features

Classifies reviews as positive or negative using machine learning.

Calculates polarity and subjectivity scores for deeper sentiment analysis.

Prints recommendations like "Must Watch!" or "Nah! not worth it".
